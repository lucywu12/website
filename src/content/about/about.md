And so you found me. 

You've probably clicked this link to understand _who I really am?_

I would love to tell you! However, this is a question I also don't have a concrete answer to.

Am I an artist? A builder? A writer? Maybe a little of all of the above.

Instead, I present to you some digital puzzle pieces, and I leave it as an exercise to you to put them together to form some kind of perception _about me_. I promise I won’t be mad with whatever you come up with.

And in the process of looking, I hope you become inspired to create something of your own. So if I really stroke my ego, maybe I am a muse, an amalgamation of all the things I find both lovely and destructive in this world.
